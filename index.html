      <section>
        <p>I’m a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley and a Research Associate at the <a href="https://cpd.berkeley.edu/">Center on the Politics of Development</a>. I research gendered understandings of: the political economy of local development, political inequality, and the consequences of climate change using mixed (in-depth qualitative, experimental, and machine-learning) methods. My dissertation project investigates the role of state and community control of natural resources in entrenching patriarchal gender relations. My research is located in the Global South, with a focus on India.
        </p>
        <p> My work focuses on gender-based violence, institutions, and claim-making, with a regional focus on South Asia. I research and teach comparative politics, political economy of develpoment, and gender-based violence. On methods, I use and teach quantiative methods, and mixed and qualitative methods, including survey and field experiments, and ethnographic and archival methods. My work relies heavily on fieldwork. 
        </p>
	<p> In my dissertation project, I study how women navigate domestic violence using institutions.  even in a context of ubiquitous support for compromise and declining help-seeking behavior, women believe that going to any institution for support decreases domestic violence. In particular, I find that the formal characteristics of informal institutions are important, and the informal characteristics of formal institutions are important, while I find less evidence for arguments about natal family support and institutional support for specific claims Specifically, women's belief that institution decrease violence is driven by their beliefs in support from women's orgnanizations, compared to women police or caste organizations.  I analyze these dynamics using 15 months of ethnographic work and 20 years of case files from a local autonomous women's organization in rural Gujarat.
	</p>
	<p> My research has been supported by the APSA Minority Fellowship, the Foreign Language Area Studies (FLAS) Dissertation Fellowship, 3ie, as well as grants the Institute of International Studies (IIS), the Center on Contemporary India (CCI), the Center for Race and Gender (CRG), and the Center on the Politics of Development (CPD) at UC Berkeley. I hold an MPA in International Development (MPA/ID) from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and a B.S. in Economics and Political Science from The Ohio State University. 
        </p>
	<p> I worked as a development economics and policy professional for organizations such as J-PAL, IDinsight, IMAGO Global Grassroots, the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics, and the World Bank, as well as with organizations such as SEWA, Transform Rural India, and the Ministry of Rural Development in Andhra Pradesh on projects encompassing  women's agency and empowerment, social norms and behavior, technology and governance, rural livelihoods, and water and sanitation.
