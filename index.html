      <section>
        <p>I am an ETH Zurich Postdoctoral Fellow hosted by the <a href="https://irds.ethz.ch/">International Relations and Data Science Lab</a>. I hold a PhD in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley and am a Research Associate at the <a href="https://cpd.berkeley.edu/">Center on the Politics of Development</a>.
	</p>
	<p> My research examines gender-based violence, institutions, and claim-making. I employ mixed methods, including experiments, ethnography, archival research, and machine learning.

        <h3>Dissertation project</h3>
        <p>
          <b>The Politics of Disclosure: Three Papers on the Dynamics of Domestic Violence Claim-Making in India</b>
          <br> This project investigates the connections between the institutions' orientations toward marriage and women's expectations of support in situations of domestic violence. I use results from a door-to-door survey experiment and survey (n=2000), fifteen months of ethnographic observation at a grassroots women's organization, archival analyses, and interviews to trace the institutional trajectories of approximately ~125 family dispute cases filed over ten years at the organization.
