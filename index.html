      <section>
        <p>I am an ETH Zurich Postdoctoral Fellow hosted by the <a href="https://irds.ethz.ch/">International Relations and Data Science Lab</a>. I hold a PhD in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley and am a Research Associate at the <a href="https://cpd.berkeley.edu/">Center on the Politics of Development</a>.
	</p>
	<p> My research examines gender-based violence and race and ethnic politics. I employ mixed methods, including in-person and online experiments, ethnography, and original archival research. I am particularly interested in incorporating insights about gendered social structures into the design of measures and data collection strategies for capturing individuals’ attitudes, beliefs, preferences, and choices, and into the analytical frameworks used to study their behavior in response to institutional and policy reforms.
